# Security Considerations

## Current Security Status
⚠️ **This is a demo environment with mock data. Do not use in production without implementing proper security measures.**

## Security Requirements for Production

### Authentication & Authorization

#### User Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** required for all users
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration with organizational identity providers
- **Session management** with secure session tokens and timeout policies
- **Password policies** meeting industry standards (NIST guidelines)

#### API Authentication
- **OAuth 2.0** with SMART on FHIR for healthcare data access
- **JWT tokens** for secure API communication
- **API keys** with proper rotation policies
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **TLS 1.3** for all data in transit
- **AES-256** encryption for data at rest
- **Field-level encryption** for sensitive PHI fields
- **Key management** using HSM or cloud key management services

#### Data Handling
- **Minimum necessary principle** - only access required data
- **Data retention policies** compliant with regulations
- **Secure data disposal** when no longer needed
- **Data anonymization** for analytics and testing

### HIPAA Compliance

#### Administrative Safeguards
- **Assigned security responsibility** with designated security officer
- **Workforce training** on HIPAA requirements
- **Access management** with role-based permissions
- **Audit procedures** and regular security assessments

#### Physical Safeguards
- **Workstation security** controls
- **Device and media controls** for portable devices
- **Facility access controls** for data centers

#### Technical Safeguards
- **Access control** with unique user identification
- **Audit controls** with comprehensive logging
- **Integrity protection** for PHI data
- **Transmission security** for data in transit

### Network Security

#### Infrastructure
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to filter malicious requests
- **DDoS protection** to ensure availability
- **VPN access** for remote administration
- **Network segmentation** to isolate sensitive systems

#### Monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** for threat detection
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** for log analysis
- **Real-time monitoring** of system access and data usage
- **Vulnerability scanning** and penetration testing

## Current Demo Vulnerabilities

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **No authentication** - all endpoints are publicly accessible
2. **No data validation** - API accepts any input without validation
3. **No rate limiting** - vulnerable to abuse and DoS attacks
4. **No audit logging** - no record of data access or modifications
5. **HTTP allowed** - should enforce HTTPS only
6. **CORS wide open** - allows requests from any origin
7. **No input sanitization** - vulnerable to injection attacks

### Mock Data Considerations
- Mock data should not resemble real patient information
- Use clearly fictional names, dates, and identifiers
- Ensure test data cannot be confused with production data

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Basic Security (Immediate)
```python
# Example: Add basic API key authentication
from functools import wraps
from flask import request, abort

def require_api_key(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        api_key = request.headers.get('X-API-Key')
        if api_key != 'your-secure-api-key':
            abort(401)
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function

@app.route('/transaction-status/<transaction_id>')
@require_api_key
def get_transaction_status(transaction_id):
    # ... existing code
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security (Short-term)
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Enable HTTPS enforcement
- Implement rate limiting
- Add comprehensive audit logging

### Phase 3: Production Security (Long-term)
- Full HIPAA compliance implementation
- Integration with Epic FHIR security model
- Advanced threat detection and response
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Security Headers

### Required Headers
```python
# Example Flask security headers
@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'SAMEORIGIN'
    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
    return response
```

### CORS Configuration
```python
# Secure CORS configuration for production
CORS(app, origins=['https://yourdomain.com'], 
     methods=['GET', 'POST'], 
     allow_headers=['Content-Type', 'Authorization'])
```

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
- Monitor system logs for unusual activity
- Alert on failed authentication attempts
- Track data access patterns

### Response
1. **Immediate containment** - isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment** - determine scope of potential breach
3. **Notification** - inform relevant parties per legal requirements
4. **Recovery** - restore services securely
5. **Post-incident review** - update security measures

## Security Testing

### Regular Assessments
- **Vulnerability scans** - automated security scanning
- **Penetration testing** - simulated attacks by security professionals  
- **Code reviews** - security-focused code analysis
- **Compliance audits** - verify adherence to regulations

### Testing Tools
- **OWASP ZAP** - web application security testing
- **Nmap** - network discovery and security auditing
- **Burp Suite** - web vulnerability scanner
- **SonarQube** - code quality and security analysis

## Compliance Frameworks

### Healthcare Specific
- **HIPAA** - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **HITECH** - Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
- **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulation (if applicable)

### General Security
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Service Organization Control 2
- **ISO 27001** - Information Security Management System
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - National Institute of Standards and Technology
